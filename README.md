# Trending music project

## Description 

This is a small project built in React + Vite that uses Audius API to display the top trending tracks in the platform. 

This app was built under the timeframe of under 2 hours and uses the default template from Vite with Typescript + Chakra UI for the styling & React Query for the data fetching and management. 

ðŸ’… A list of a few nice features:
- Displays the tracks with a few filters by genre
- Let's you search by track title and/or genre of music 
- Ability to like specific tracks and sort the tracks by liked first

## How to run the project 
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. See console for the port used to run locally 

## Nice to haves in the future
1. Add tests for the filtering, sorting logic
2. Add a nice prettier formatting to the code, this is more of a nitpick but things like the prop string formatting could be cleaner. 
3. Display user info of the track
4. Add more filters
